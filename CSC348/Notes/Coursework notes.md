# Notes about the coursework, a walkthrough of the ruberick

Submit a zip file of all of your source code. The file must be named `2006652.zip`

The video should be split into sections. The sections should be based on the questions in the submissions, explicitly stating what you are saying i.e. "Here I am showing how users can leave comments". The answers to the questions should just be a timestamp for the video for the corresponding section.

"For password lets put, uhh, tribute. ...it's not the greatest password in the world."

structure the video in order of the ruberick, to make seans life easier.

Note: The same thing cannot be marked twice. I.e., anything that covers two mark boxes cannot be counted for both.
Most of this should be showing the functional site - show it working, maybe also show some code but the code is not the focus

## Progress
·Make a web app that works with no major bugs
·Show 


## User presence
·Users can log in
·Items and comments are clearly linked to the users who posted them. I.e. you can click on a users name to view their profile and see their posts and comments
·Multiple levels of authorization with different permissions in what they can do. I.e. an admin can edit everyones post
·Users can only edit their own posts unless a role specifies otherwise.
·Notifications

## Working with data
·Web app which allows users to create and edit items with no major bugs
·Illustrate that validation has been implemented. This has to be separate from the built in validation that laravel adds.
·Evidence of correctly implemented relationships
·Users can upload images which are displayed with their posts
·Polymorphic relationships are used and implemented correctly. You will have to show code to fulfill this requirement

## Implementation
Leave question 5 to last. Question 5 is just, the content of the lecture on december 6th
