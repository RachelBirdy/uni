# Data Visualization
## Lecture 1 baybee

Showing data in detail allows you to see patterns and trends in data that aren't visible from statistics alone.

It allows human vision to be used to process data - this is a very powerful, ready made tool that we already have at our disposal

Vision is pused because it is high bandwidth and processes a lot of data at a preconscious level.

If information is in a user's head, it can't be visualized. If information is in a computer and the task is clearly and well defined, algorithmic automation is possible. The rest of the time, visualization is a suitable approach.

Visualization can help people understand problems and develop computational models. For example, a map of deaths by location showed a cholera outbreak in london was centered around a pump.

The human eye is more sensitive to colour than shape, I think?

There are limitations ot visualization - human limits like time, memory, attention. There are display limits like screen space and pixel density, and there are computational limits.
