A tuple of sets of conditions, events and flow relations (N=(C,E,F)) is called a net if and only if the following holds:
C and E are disjoint sets
F is a subset of (CxE)U(ExC); is a binary relation (flow relation)

F is not reflexive

Oh my god just look at the recording for all this

N, the natural  umbers symbol does not include 0. However, if you add a 0 subscript then it includes 0

Lower case omega is roughly equal to infinity
