Simulating an entire solar system is hard! Outer Wilds is an example of this.

As floating points get bigger, they get less accurate. This is a problem. In the outer wilds, the way the developers worked around this for simulating an entire solar system, is the player position doesn't actually move, as you "move" it's actually the entire solar system that moves instead.
