·2D vs 2D (URP)
URP stands for Universal Render Pipeline. The URP lets you do things like sprite lighting and shadows. Sounds like, when selecting a project, selecting URP might be a good idea!

·Game objects
In unity, every game object is a collection of classes. For instance, a camera game object is comprised of a Camera class, and a Transfrom class. There are C# classes, and they all inherit the class MonoBehaviour. All game objects require a transform.
